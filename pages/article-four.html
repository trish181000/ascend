      <h2>What Are Cells?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered what makes up every living thing on Earthâ€”including you? The answer is cells. These microscopic units are the smallest structures capable of performing all the functions of life. Whether itâ€™s a blade of grass, a buzzing bee, or a human body, cells are the foundation. In fact, your body contains around 37 trillion cells (Bianconi et al., 2013)!
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        Cells are often referred to as the <strong>"building blocks of life"</strong>, and for good reason. They form the structure of all organisms and carry out the processes needed to survive.
      </p><br>
  
      <div class="theory-list">
        <p><strong>The Cell Theory</strong>, a fundamental concept in biology, states that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All living things are made up of cells.</li>
          <li>The cell is the basic unit of structure and function in living organisms.</li>
          <li>All cells come from pre-existing cells.</li>
        </ul>
      </div><br>
  
      <p>
        This theory was developed in the 1800s thanks to scientists like <strong>Matthias Schleiden</strong>, <strong>Theodor Schwann</strong>, and <strong>Rudolf Virchow</strong>, who used early microscopes to study plant and animal tissues.

      <h2>Types of Cells</h2>
      <p>There are two main categories of cells:</p>
  
      <div class="cell-type">
        <h3>ðŸ¦  Prokaryotic Cells</h3>
        <p>
          These are simple, small cells without a nucleus. Instead, their DNA floats freely inside the cell.
          <strong>Bacteria</strong> and <strong>archaea</strong> are examples of prokaryotic organisms.
          They might be simple, but theyâ€™re incredibly important to ecosystems and even human health.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="cell-type">
        <h3>ðŸ§« Eukaryotic Cells</h3>
        <p>
          These are more complex cells with a <strong>nucleus</strong>â€”a special compartment that holds the cellâ€™s DNA.
          <strong>Animals, plants, fungi,</strong> and <strong>protists</strong> are made of eukaryotic cells.
          These cells also have <em>membrane-bound organelles</em>, which are like tiny machines that help the cell survive and function.

      <h2>Why Are Cells So Important?</h2>
      <p>
        Cells arenâ€™t just passive building blocksâ€”they are alive, and theyâ€™re constantly working. They divide to help organisms grow, heal wounds, and replace old or damaged cells. Specialized cells also perform specific functions, like sending signals in your brain or transporting oxygen in your blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studying cells helps scientists understand how our bodies work, how diseases like cancer develop, and how we might use stem cells to repair tissues in the future. Even vaccines, like the ones developed for COVID-19, are based on how cells react to invaders and produce immune responses <span class="citation">(Khan Academy, n.d.)</span>.
