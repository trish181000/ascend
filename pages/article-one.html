    <h2>Computer Networking</h2>
    <p>
      The process of bridging two or more computing devices to facilitate
       the communication of information and resources though physical or 
       wireless mediums (“What is computer networking?”, 2024) (“SMB 
       University: Selling Cisco,” n.d.). When these devices have indeed
        formed connections between each other, we call this a network.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there are many different types of networks, two basic setups will be discussed:
    </p>
    <p>
      Local Area Network (LAN) – a collection of connected devices in one 
      physical location (“What is computer networking?”, 2024) (“What is 
      Computer Networking?”, n.d.) (“SMB University: Selling Cisco,” n.d.).
       A LAN can vary in size and include both wired and wireless devices 
       (“What is computer networking?”, 2024) (“What is Computer Networking?”, 
       n.d.) (“SMB University: Selling Cisco,” n.d.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Wide Area Network (WAN) – a collection of LANs and/or individual devices
       that stretches over a large geographical area (“What is computer 
       networking?”, 2024) (“What is Computer Networking?”, n.d.) (“SMB 
       University: Selling Cisco,” n.d.). WANs are typically used by large 
       organizations and government bodies (“What is computer networking?”, 
       2024) (“What is Computer Networking?”, n.d.) (“SMB University: Selling
        Cisco,” n.d.).

  For any network, there are three basic network devices that must be 
  included to provide proper connection between devices:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Switch</strong> – this device establishes the connection between devices within a 
  network and act as a controller in a LAN (“What is Computer Networking?”,
   n.d.).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Router</strong> – this device connects multiple networks together and to the Internet.
   It acts as a forwarder that chooses the best path to take to send the 
   information it receives (“What is Computer Networking?”, n.d.).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Access Point (AP)</strong> – this device allows wireless to create a connection with
   a network without the use of cables. It acts as an amplifier where a 
   network’s wireless signal is transmitted across an area to wireless clients
  (“What is Computer Networking?”, n.d.).

  <h2>OSI 7-Layer Model</h2>
  <p>
    The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 7-Layer Model is a theoretical structure 
    that separates network communication into seven layers (“What is OSI Model?”,
     n.d.). Since sending data over a network is quite complex, this framework 
     makes clear divides in the networking process and provides a universal 
     language for network administrators, designers, IT professionals, and various technologies 
     (“SMB University: Selling Cisco,” n.d.) (“What is OSI Model?”, n.d.). Every layer depends 
     on technologies, protocols, and methods used in the previous layer, with Layer 1 (Physical) 
     being the foundation. Not all systems that utilize the OSI model apply every layer 
     (“What is OSI Model?”, n.d.).

    <h2>Network Security</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Network Security</strong> is the design and practice of protecting a network; this includes its data, 
      resources, clients, connection methods, usability, and accessibility (“What Is Network Security?”, n.d.). It 
      achieves this using hardware and software technologies, methods, protocols, policies, and controls (“What Is 
      Network Security?”, n.d.). By combining multiple layers of this security, a network is provided with comprehensive 
      protection from unauthorized access, hackers, and vulnerabilities (“What Is Network Security?”, n.d.); this is also known as 
      <strong>Defense in Depth</strong>. Examples of network security include firewalls, email security, anti-virus 
      and anti-malware software, network segmentation, access control, application security, and data loss prevention
       (“What Is Network Security?”, n.d.).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Defense in Depth</strong> – An information security strategy that utilizes people, technology, and operations to create protective barriers across multiple layers of a network (“defense-in-depth”, n.d.).
