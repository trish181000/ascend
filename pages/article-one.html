    <h2>Computer Networking</h2>
    <p>
      The process of bridging two or more computing devices to facilitate
       the communication of information and resources though physical or 
       wireless mediums (“What is computer networking?”, 2024) (“SMB 
       University: Selling Cisco,” n.d.). When these devices have indeed
        formed connections between each other, we call this a network.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there are many different types of networks, two basic setups will be discussed:
    </p>
    <p>
      Local Area Network (LAN) – a collection of connected devices in one 
      physical location (“What is computer networking?”, 2024) (“What is 
      Computer Networking?”, n.d.) (“SMB University: Selling Cisco,” n.d.).
       A LAN can vary in size and include both wired and wireless devices 
       (“What is computer networking?”, 2024) (“What is Computer Networking?”, 
       n.d.) (“SMB University: Selling Cisco,” n.d.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Wide Area Network (WAN) – a collection of LANs and/or individual devices
       that stretches over a large geographical area (“What is computer 
       networking?”, 2024) (“What is Computer Networking?”, n.d.) (“SMB 
       University: Selling Cisco,” n.d.). WANs are typically used by large 
       organizations and government bodies (“What is computer networking?”, 
       2024) (“What is Computer Networking?”, n.d.) (“SMB University: Selling
        Cisco,” n.d.).

<p>
  For any network, there are three basic network devices that must be 
  included to provide proper connection between devices:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Switch</strong> – this device establishes the connection between devices within a 
  network and act as a controller in a LAN (“What is Computer Networking?”,
   n.d.).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Router</strong> – this device connects multiple networks together and to the Internet.
   It acts as a forwarder that chooses the best path to take to send the 
   information it receives (“What is Computer Networking?”, n.d.).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Access Point (AP)</strong> – this device allows wireless to create a connection with
   a network without the use of cables. It acts as an amplifier where a 
   network’s wireless signal is transmitted across an area to wireless clients
  (“What is Computer Networking?”, n.d.).

  <h2>OSI 7-Layer Model</h2>
  <p>
    The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 7-Layer Model is a theoretical structure 
    that separates network communication into seven layers (“What is OSI Model?”,
     n.d.). Since sending data over a network is quite complex, this framework 
     makes clear divides in the networking process and provides a universal 
     language for network administrators, designers, IT professionals, and various technologies 
     (“SMB University: Selling Cisco,” n.d.) (“What is OSI Model?”, n.d.). Every layer depends 
     on technologies, protocols, and methods used in the previous layer, with Layer 1 (Physical) 
     being the foundation. Not all systems that utilize the OSI model apply every layer 
     (“What is OSI Model?”, n.d.).
