  <h2>What is Computer Hardware?</h2>
  <p>Computer hardware includes all the physical parts that make up a computer. These are the things you can see and touch — like the keyboard, screen, and the parts hidden inside the computer case. Hardware is different from software, which is made up of programs that tell the hardware what to do.</p>

      <div class="column">
        <p><strong>Hardware</strong> is everything you can physically touch. Inside the computer case, these are the components that are screwed into place or plugged into the motherboard.</p><br>
  <p><strong>Software</strong> is made up of code and instructions that run on the hardware. You can't see it, but it’s what tells your computer what to do.</p><br>
  <p>A computer only works properly when hardware and software work together. Without hardware, software has nothing to run on. And without software, hardware doesn’t know what to do.</p>

      <div class="column">
        <p>Computer hardware is typically classified into two categories: internal and external components. Internal components are essential for the computer to run, while external components are attached to enhance functionality or provide additional features. Components like a mouse, keyboard, or speakers are some examples of external hardware.</p>
